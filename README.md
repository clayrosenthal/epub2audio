#### American English
- `af_bella` (Female, Grade A-) - High quality with extended training
- `af_heart` (Female, Grade A) - Best overall quality
- `af_nicole` (Female, Grade B-) - Good quality with extended training
- `am_fenrir` (Male, Grade C+) - Best male voice option

#### British English
- `bf_emma` (Female, Grade B-) - Best British female voice
- `bm_fable` (Male, Grade C) - Best British male voice

epub2audio input.epub \
  --output output.ogg \
  --voice af_bella \
  --speech-rate 1.0 \
  --quiet
```

### Command Line Options

- `--voice`, `-v`: Name of the voice to use (default: af_heart)
- `--speech-rate`, `-r`: Speech rate multiplier (default: 1.0)
- `--quiet`, `-q`: Suppress progress reporting
- `--verbose`, `-v`: Output more verbose logs
- `--cache`, `-c`: Cache generated audio files for reuse
- `--max-chapters`, `-m`: Max number of chapters to generate, or -1 for unlimited
- `--format`, `-f`: Output container format

## Voice Quality Grades

Voices are graded based on quality and training data:

- **A**: Exceptional quality, extensive training
- **B**: Good quality, suitable for most uses
- **C**: Average quality, may have minor issues
- **D**: Basic quality, may have noticeable issues
- **F**: Limited quality, recommended only if necessary

Modifiers (+/-) indicate slight variations within each grade.

### Running Tests

Using mise:
```bash
# Run all tests
mise run test

# Run integration tests
mise run test-integration

# Run with coverage
mise run test-coverage
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run integration tests
pytest --run-integration

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Code Quality

The project uses:
- Ruff for formatting and linting
- MyPy for type checking
- Pytest for testing

To format and lint code:
```bash
mise run format  # Format code
mise run lint    # Check code
mise run fix     # Auto-fix issues
```

## Error Handling

#### Critical Errors (Exit with error code)
1. Invalid/corrupted EPUB file
2. Invalid voice model selection
3. File system errors (read/write permissions)
4. Insufficient disk space

#### Non-Critical Errors (Warning and continue)
1. Non-text elements in EPUB
2. Unsupported metadata fields
